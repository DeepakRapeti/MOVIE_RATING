# MOVIE_REVIEW
Well start by loading in the IMDB movie review dataset from keras. This dataset contains 25,000 reviews from IMDB where each one is already preprocessed and has a label as either positive or negative. Each review is encoded by integers that represents how common a word is in the entire dataset. For example, a word encoded by the integer 3 means that it is the 3rd most common word in the dataset
it is used to predict the movie rating  by the review given in the form of the words, it will give a good rating for the movie if the review is good with words like "awesome, super, exiting, thrilling,......etc", gives less rating if the movie review consists of words like "disappointing, boring, waste,....etc"
